      <description>Introduction This research looks at homicide cases in Toronto from 2004 to 2019. The dataset was taken from Open Data Toronto.
The main interests are on the type of homicide and the occurrence year. I expected that the cases of homicide would increase with time but the results show that the number did not really increase with time.
Another interest was to find which area has the most cases but there are 134 unique areas in the data so it was difficult to represent the results in a graph.</description>
